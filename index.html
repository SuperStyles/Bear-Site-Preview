	<h2>Some Things About Him</h2>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<p class="fittingsize">Well, we can first start with his enamoring demeanor. He encourages everyone to move under true good work and pride themselves to serving their customers. He really doesn't have to go on and explain his whole performance (even though he will), he'll let his work ethic speak for itself. If you desire a bear who is enthusiastic about his work, and is willing to reach the ends of the Earth for your satisfaction, then you should consider Jamaal Jackson as your #1 choice in bear-kind service. Hit him up and hopefully he can be your first (maybe even second, or third) choice of business!</p>
		<li>Maybe he can mow your lawn! (standing)</li>
		<li>Catch your fish for you!</li>
		<li>Make a really good Yogie Bear actor. (If anyone knows)</li>
		<li>Be a real life experience version of your favorite teddy bear.</li>
	</ul>

		<p class="w3-center w3-padding-50">Don't overlook 'im, Jamaal Jackson is a bear of excitement. Not too many people know about his expeditions to Canada, or his discoveries he found while hiking the mountains in Russia. As a bear, he has a hiking kind of nature to him. He also has a hand in the Memphis basketball team, but he doesn't usually like to get into that. When Jamaal hikes, he's also on the lookout for his free meals in the wild. Fish with blueberries and a special sauce is what he loves the most. Give him that and he might let you tour his land.</p>
	<h1 class="moved">The Importance of Bearhood</h1>
		<p class="w3-center w3-padding-50">When it comes to bears, these creatures can be relatively nice as long as you don't pester them. Most animals won't harm you unless you pose as a threat to them or they have another reason to attack you. Love and appreciate a bear, like Jamaal, and he will love and appreciate you. There's nothing to it!</p>
